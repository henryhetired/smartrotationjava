Instruction to configure the smart rotation server and client

config files need to be in the workspace

Make sure the port that the server need to work on is open

To start the program:


from command line:


run "java -jar SmartRotationProcessing.jar $server_config"


After "Server Started" printed, the server is ready to accept processing request using the following command structure:


----Command structure----
0) Initialize the analysis server
   runcommand initialize $workspace
   EXAMPLE COMMAND:
   
   runcommand initialize /mnt/fileserver/workspace/
   
1) Evaluate the fix spacing single timepoint data, with gen_fig option to generate a coverage vs num_angle figure:	
   runcommand evaluation $filepath $timepoint $numberofangles $gap $gen_fig(0=Off, 1=On)
   EXAMPLE COMMAND:
   
   runcommand evaluation /mnt/fileserver/data/ 0 2 1
   
   evaluate data stored at /mnt/fileserver/data/ timepoint 0 with 2 gap (if 24 angles used, 12 angles evaluated) and generate a coverage convergence curve and save to the workspace
2) Process a single angular stack that comes in
   runcommand processangle $filepath $timepoint $angle
   EXAMPLE COMMAND:
   
   runcommand processangle /mnt/fileserver/data/ 0 5

   evaluate data at /mnt/fileserver/data/, specifically data at timepoint 0, angleidx 5
3) Query the current estimation of optimal angle and send back to the client
   runcommand getupdate

   The data received by the client is in the following format
   angles=$a0,$a1.....

   It is then up to the microscope control software to parse the necessary information.
